		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Alberto!

I hope so too! But please don&#039;t talk to me about those exams! They were nightmares to me and I&#039;m just trying to wake up.

I&#039;m glad to know you&#039;re there right now! By the way, I&#039;ll go home too just after the exams.

Till september!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey dude!

I got your email about your blogs (both the personal one and the technical one) today. It&#039;s great. Hope you blog quite often on the technical side, it&#039;s great seeing people push so hard for free software.

I&#039;m back at home, hope it didn&#039;t go so bad in june after all :)

See u in september!
