		<description><![CDATA[Be LEARY of any online company that does not openly provide a telephone number. I have personally never been so disrespected by a online company! I submitted a BBB claim. I did not like the fact that they don&#039;t use cpanel (which I had the option of using with a previous host), but the responses by email are so rude and unprofessional. Don&#039;t give them your business! I would be more than happy to post the exchanges I&#039;ve had with this company. I&#039;m not sure if their cs reps weren&#039;t loved as children, but they are the worst!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dreamhost did suck really badly in terms of uptime. One thing I really liked about their system was snapshot backups and how we could get at the data if we deleted it by mistake! I couldn&#039;t handle the downtime any more and so I started to search for hosts that had the snapshot backup system, I found this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uptimehost.com&quot;/ rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hosting provider&lt;/a&gt;. Does anyone know about them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[DreamHost&#039;s poor customer service has led to a serious privacy invasion. When my client attempted to sign up for an account, the transaction hung halfway through. When customer service (which can only be reached by tedious email exchanges) &quot;fixed&quot; the problem, the pay by credit card option was no longer available. The customer service representative insisted that we use Google Payments. I proceeded, and then my client realized his financial information is now in the Google system. The worst possible scenario then came true. Instead of completing the transaction, Google called my client&#039;s bank for &quot;preapproval&quot;. This was not to complete the transaction (which was never completed), but to gather information for Google&#039;s marketing. My client is furious, reviewing everyone&#039;s privacy policy,  and is looking into ways to bring this problem up at the political, and possibly the legal, level. 

Throughout this whole situation, Dreamhost has been nothing but pig-headed. Every customer service representative ignores the case history and either refers us back to Google Payments or says patronizing things like we could have paid with the original credit card system. I offered them a solution where I quietly pay for the account using Google transactions, and they won&#039;t even let me help bail them out!!!

I will never refer another client to dreamhost. Right now I&#039;m looking for the best place to air this complaint publicly in as many places as possible. People have to know that when Dreamhost pushes people into using Google Payments, Google then has their financial information to aggregate and deploy for their own purposes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have had great success with DreamHost! It has not let me down a single time!

I once made a 3rd party picture section for Digg (&lt;a href=&quot;http://digpicz.com&quot;/ rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;digpicz.com&lt;/a&gt;, (see also &lt;a href=&quot;http://reddit.picurls.com&quot;/ rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reddit pics&lt;/a&gt; :)), and the shared hosting for $9.95 a month handled 100&#039;000 (hundred thousand!!!) visitors the first day!

I blogged what I optimized to handle such a traffic on a cheap shared host in this post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catonmat.net/blog/few-words-about-digpicz-dot-com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A few words about Digpicz.com&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah I&#039;ve gotten fed up with dreamhosts too. If you find some one similar without all the down times, I&#039;d love to know.

I&#039;ve heard mixed things about mediatemple.net]]></description>
