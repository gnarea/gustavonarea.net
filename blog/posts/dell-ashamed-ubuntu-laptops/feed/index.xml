strange things happen. If you look at dell.it/ubuntu , you get a choice of freedos or ubuntu shipped machines, among which you can find the xps 1330.

		<description><![CDATA[One thing that I never seem to see anyone mention on any Linux debate in response to the oh-so-annoying question &quot;If Linux is so great, why isn&#039;t it popular?&quot;
I completely fail to realize why nobody realizes this:
Linux doesn&#039;t have the commercial support that Windows/OS X have! Linux is mainly developed by VOLUNTEERS, most of whom have time-consuming jobs. And as for what commercial support it does have: Canonical is hoping to turn a profit soon. Bill Gates is worth $40 billion.
Microsoft and Apple have the money to advertise, while Linux doesn&#039;t. And Linux would have more commercial support if companies and their stockholders weren&#039;t so afraid of short-term profit margin declines, especially in this economy.
However, more companies (i.e. Google) are starting to support Linux, but not at the level of Microsoft and Apple. Operating Systems take a lot of work and time; that&#039;s why Linux wasn&#039;t &quot;ready&quot; when Microsoft and Apple got their footholds in the computer market.

And as for the &quot;Waa, Ubuntu doesn&#039;t support my random, obscure, bleeding-edge piece of hardware&quot; comments: Let&#039;s not forget that no operating system is perfect... But once it&#039;s supported (and it will be in time), I don&#039;t have to install any drivers via CD that come with loads of crapware (i.e. HP printers). Loads of hardware work literally out-of-box (I just printed from a Live CD; can anything else do that?) and loads more are supported by a simple WYSIWYG interface.

And as for the original article: Dell is a large company and has to have a large and very organized structure to its system (which includes all its documentation and, of course, STAFF), which probably only included Windows before. Now these changes are requiring a complete refresh. It&#039;s going to take time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve stopped buying or using any versions of Windows and use Linux as my OS of choice. The reason is that I simply got fed up of wasting countless hours re-installing/ patching/ dealing with virus and spamware related problems. A typical example was a family friend who is in his 60&#039;s. He uses his PC for business email, some spreadsheet work, browsing and wordprocessing. Having spent donkey&#039;s years working with computers I am (a lot of you will identify with this) source of permanent, free, 24/7 advice and technical support. This guy doesn&#039;t do much with his machine and his lack of worldly knowledge regarding the opening of emails with attachments has caused me hours of work getting his machine to work. I can&#039;t tell you how many times his internet connection has been hijacked over the years. He&#039;s no fool, mind, and the last time he mistook a piece of malware masqerading as a genuine UPS email, I told him that I simply couldn&#039;t support him any longer. Life is just too short. I told him that I was going to install Linux Ubuntu and that he would be free from all these problems (fingers crossed, admittedly). SInce then, over two years have passed and there has not been a single issue, no internet hijacking, no incredibly slow boot times, nothing at all that could be considered detrimental has occured. I do realise that many users have significant commercial and technical demands to make of their PCs and that Linux can be a difficult path to tread (Accounting software for example). However, for many users, simply having a system that works, is extremely unlikely to be compromised, offers peace of mind and just lets them get on with their computing, is worth its weight in gold. It certainly is for me. I refuse to support Windows anymore and life is just so much easier.]]></description>
