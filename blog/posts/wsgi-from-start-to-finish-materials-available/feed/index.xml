		<description><![CDATA[Hello, Dharmavirsinh.

It&#039;s hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linode.com/?r=5d1565e30bb93355e48d162c1a1ce49fa6bc638c&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt;, which, by the way, I would highly recommend to anyone.

HTH.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Asking you a question about hosting, as read your past post about webfaction.com
Your website is pretty fast do you still host it with webfaction.com?

if not where?

Kudos.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Graham:

Thanks for the note on chunked request content! I&#039;ve just updated the slides.

BTW, WebOb&#039;s request wrapper sets CONTENT_LENGTH to &quot;-1&quot; when people set the body of the request to a file-like object; if it&#039;s a string, its length is used.

Cheers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One comment about your slides.

Under &#039;No unknown length wsgi.input&#039; you state &#039;Some libraries use “-1”.&#039; and &#039;Others use “0”, which actually means “there are no bytes in wsgi.input”.&#039;. If any WSGI hosting mechanism is using &#039;-1&#039; then they are likely violating both CGI and WSGI specifications and would also probably break any WSGI applications. The use of &#039;-1&#039; has only ever been a suggestion as far as I know for a future version of WSGI and not actually used.

Where chunked request content is used, there is no Content-Length header. Technically there should also probably thus be no CONTENT_LENGTH variable at all in the WSGI environment and WSGI specification allows for it to be missing, but wouldn&#039;t be surprised if some WSGI adapters always populate it with 0 even though no such header supplied.

The only one way of really knowing if have unknown length request content is to have no CONTENT_LENGTH and check HTTP_TRANSFER_ENCODING for &#039;chunked&#039;. The only WSGI hosting mechanism I know of that supports that is Apache/mod_wsgi and even then you have to set the WSGIChunkedRequest directive to allow handling of chunked request content, given that it sits outside of the WSGI specification.]]></description>
