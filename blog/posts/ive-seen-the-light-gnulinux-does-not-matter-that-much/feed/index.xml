		<description><![CDATA[sounds an awful lot like you want us to use FUD to attack windows, and it&#039;s proprietary formats.

unfortunately even though I am a linux user and store all my docs in html/odt I have to convert them for windows users to .doc because they don&#039;t seem to be capable of using html files or links to web pages (for basic documents). the change will not happen by pushing formats. but offering them free software to work on proprietary formats/protocols could help. examples pidgin, openoffice, gimp, vlc, firefox, and anything else you can think of that will help get them comfortable using programs in a linux environment. once we have critical mass, people will start using odt, and perhaps jabber (once we can talk to all our friends on it).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Aside their inability to follow their thoughts (the games excuse is included here)&quot;

Please clarify: are you taking a jab at people who hang to Windows for its gamin support? If that is the case, you are wrong to do so. 

Would you insult a bank for using Windows because it is the only operating system which has a decent database / finance suite?

I agree with your post. However, you must accept that games are the one area of programs that is noticeably handicapped when compared to its competition in Windows.

In fact, I believe that if games were prevalent on Linux, huge numbers of users (mainly young males, who are otherwise the most interested group in trying FOSS) would migrate to Linux/BSD. Fully CROSS-platform gaming, like Nexuiz, are a great start. Consumer market share will increase once more high-quality, graphically impressive, entertaining games come out on the *nix platform.]]></description>
